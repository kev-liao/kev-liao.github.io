        <p>I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, generously supported by an NSF Graduate Fellowship.<br><br>

        My research mission is to make provable security more meaningful and cost-effective to achieve in practice. That is, I combine techniques from cryptography, programming languages, and formal verification to develop new forms of abstraction and modularity for building security-critical software.
