          <p>I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, generously supported by an NSF Graduate Fellowship. I work with <a href="http://soc1024.ece.illinois.edu/">Andrew Miller</a> in the <a href="http://decentralize.ece.illinois.edu/">Decentralized Systems Lab</a>.<br><br>
        
        My research focuses on developing a theory and practice of compositionality for building security-critical software. My work combines techniques from cryptography, programming languages, and verification to integrate ways of reasoning about security into the inherently compositional way that software is built.
