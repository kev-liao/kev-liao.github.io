          <p>I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, generously supported by an NSF Graduate Fellowship. <br><br>
		My research interests are in computer security &amp; privacy, applied cryptography, and programming languages. Currently, my projects focus on improving the security of decentralized systems (i.e., cryptocurrencies) and developing tools to find web vulnerabilities.<br><br>
		I am a researcher at the <a href="http://sefcom.asu.edu/">Laboratory of Secure Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM)</a> advised by <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~gahn1/">Gail-Joon Ahn</a> and <a href="http://adamdoupe.com/">Adam Doup√©</a>. Previously, I spent a summer at the <a href="http://cyber.umd.edu/">University of Maryland Cybersecurity Center (MC2)</a> advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/">Jonathan Katz</a>.</p>
