          <p><b>NEWS:</b> I'm happy to announce that I'll be joining the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as a PhD student in the Fall.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is Kevin! I am a fourth year undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>. <br><br>
		My research interests are broadly in computer security &amp; privacy, applied cryptography, and programming languages. Currently, my projects focus on cryptocurrencies, web security, and program synthesis. <br><br>
